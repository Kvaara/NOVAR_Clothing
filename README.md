# NOVAR Clothing    ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kvaara/NOVAR_Clothing/main/src/assets/logo_transparent_svg.svg)
This is a pretty big React project that I've been working on. Many of the React libraries and tools have been implemented/used such as [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html), [Redux](https://react-redux.js.org/), [Redux-Saga](https://redux-saga.js.org/), [React Router](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router), [React Context API](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html) and [session storage](https://www.robinwieruch.de/local-storage-react).

In addition, I have used the [Redux-Persist](https://www.npmjs.com/package/redux-persist) library for session persistence. I've also tried to use [Memoization](https://rossbulat.medium.com/how-to-memoize-in-react-3d20cbcd2b6e) in all possible aspects (**tried**) for the sake of performance increases.

You can make an account on the website using email and password or you can simply just login through Google! I have used Google Firebase as a backend for the authentication and registeration.

This project itself is a lot like an e-commerce website where you could buy clothing & accessories. The payment would be done through [Stripe](https://stripe.com/en-fi).

> Note: project is still in development! The development is about 75% done.

**However, the application is production ready (to an extent) and can be found on Heroku:**
